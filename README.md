From this information the NCEI hopes to provide resources for people to make decisions that allow the world to operate more efficiently and efficiently when it comes to the environment, economy, and everyones and everthings safety. In fact, the NCEI gathers tens of millions of gigabytes of data in order to support their research. The NCEI ranges from the deep-sea corals and sponges, the freeze in Texas in the year of 2021, the Earth's magnetic field, and so much more.

- Student Research and Learning - The NCEI allows for students in many different fields of study to research and analyze real-life past and current events, new discoveries, and more that are happening in the world around them. 

- Differs Professional Roles- The NCEI gathers such a big variety of data that can be used by biologists, geoscientists, astronomers, and so much more to not only help figure out past and current events, but also help prepare for the future.

<ins>Introduction</ins> - Within the book [Data Science: An Introduction](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Science:_An_Introduction), the author explains to the audience that this book is a very much introduction book where you do not need past knowledge of Data Science. This book is a great book if you want to create a good foundation for what data science is and what it is used for. Furthermore, even though this book does share with the reader that skills and knowing how to use tools is important, it also implies that the most important part of data science is to be able to problem solve and have outside of the box thinking. 

<ins>Why I Choose this Book</ins> - When I was first looking through the list of books that are provided on the list I was looking for something that was unusual and different. I wanted to focus on something that wasn’t general but was more specific with an interesting topic. However, the more I thought about it I decided I wanted to learn more about data science in general. It’s my personal opinion that it is important to build a good foundation for new topics or subjects that you are currently learning. Without a good foundation there is nothing to build off of. With that being said I wanted my book that I choose to be more of an introduction so a book with introduction in the title seemed like the perfect choice.
